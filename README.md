# SP-500-Trading-System
This is a trading system with the same methodologies of Meb Faber's, but applied to S&P 500 Stocks. 

Unlike the other ETF systems this does not utilize excel, instead similar to the other Trading Systems this has a python file that provides Top 5 Momentum assets. 

In the future I will provide updates for the tools that are more interactive and will be rolling out a desktop application for pulling the data needed to run the excel file. Meaning that users that do not know how to use python will also have access to these tools and trading systems.
